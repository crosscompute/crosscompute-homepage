<td>Data Warehouse</td>
<td>We are adding a Data Warehouse to our Standard Service. Building the pipelines that populate datasets in the Data Warehouse will consume Support Tickets.</td>
<td>Providing a single access point for datasets makes it easier to analyze data and generate reports. The latest version of each dataset will be clearly marked.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>MIT License</td>
<td>The next version of the CrossCompute Analytics Automation System will be open source under the MIT License. We are writing documentation to help our system become the standard for analytics automation.</td>
<td>You can generate revenue by selling licenses to analytics that organizations can include in their own customer and regulatory reports.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Progressive Disclosure</td>
<td>We are upgrading the Automation Framework to support progressive disclosure forms that generate reports.</td>
<td>Progressive disclosure increases the likelihood that a user will complete the form and submit data.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Support Documentation</td>
<td>A Support Ticket now includes documentation and a training session in addition to custom service. The price of a Support Ticket has increased from $2,000 to $2,500.</td>
<td>Documentation and training increase institutional capacity and knowledge.</td>

<p>Custom Services are priced using Support Tickets. Each Analytics Automation Support Ticket ($2,500 / ticket) includes a custom deliverable, documentation and training session to accelerate report automation.</p>

<h4>Custom Service: Data Warehouse Integration</h4>

<h5>Problem</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Multiple data sources make report preparation time-consuming.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Proposed Solution</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Provide a single access point for datasets by populating a Data Warehouse with version control. Code for the Data Warehouse will be owned by CrossCompute and will be open source under an MIT License. The Data Warehouse will only be accessible programmatically via its REST API and will not have a web interface.</li>
  <li>Automate dataset updates by building data pipelines that aggregate internal and external data sources into the Data Warehouse. Code for the data pipelines to update the Data Warehouse will be owned by your organization.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Expected Benefit</h5>
<ul>
<li>Simplify analysis for commonly used datasets.</li>
<li>Serve visualizations and reports even when data sources are temporarily down.</li>
<li>Track changes to spatial and tabular data.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Scope of Work</h5>
<h6>Phase: Report Dataset</h6>
<ol>
  <li>Identify a dataset needed to generate a specific report.</li>
  <li>Write scripts to update the dataset from internal and external data sources.</li>
  <li>Configure a REST server to serve the dataset and authenticate requests using public-key cryptography.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Cost</h5>
4-7 Support Tickets per Phase depending on dataset complexity

<h4>Custom Service: Interactive Information Filters</h4>

<h5>Problem</h5>
<ul>
<li>Readers cannot interactively filter data in visualizations in your report.</li>
<li>Filters are search queries that pinpoint information by hiding irrelevant data.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Proposed Solution</h5>
<ul>
<li>Let users filter data in your visualizations. Code for the interactive view plugins will be owned by CrossCompute and will be open source under an MIT License.
</li>
<li>Check that users can interact with information filters for widgets embedded in reports and websites.
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Expected Benefit</h5>
<ul>
<li>Help report readers and website visitors pinpoint information.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Scope of Work</h5>
<h6>Phase: Custom Widget with Filters</h6>
<ol>
<li>Make an example widget with data for testing data filter functionality.</li>
<li>Implement custom filters for widget.</li>
</ol>

<h5>Cost</h5>
3-5 Support Tickets per Phase depending on widget complexity

<h4>Custom Service: Hazard Mitigation Grant Proposal Wizard</h4>

<h5>Problem</h5>
<ul>
<li>Gathering data to prepare a Hazard Mitigation Grant Proposal is hard.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Proposed Solution</h5>
<ul>
<li>Deploy a web-based GIS to help your community gather data to prioritize infrastructure upgrades. Code for Infrastructure Planner will be owned by CrossCompute and will be open source under an MIT License.</li>
<li>Draft documentation so that your community can deploy Infrastructure Planner securely on your own servers.</li>
<li>Deploy a Hazard Mitigation Grant Proposal Wizard. Code for the Hazard Mitigation Grant Proposal Wizard will be owned by CrossCompute and will be open source under an MIT License.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Expected Benefit</h5>
<ul>
<li>Help your community win Hazard Mitigation Grants to upgrade infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Scope of Work</h5>
<h6>Phase: Benefit Cost Analysis</h6>
<ol>
<li>Identify recommended hazard mitigation strategies for your community. </li>
<li>Identify data needed to justify each hazard mitigation strategy for benefit cost analysis (see Benefit Cost Analysis).</li>
<li>Draft a wizard that your community can use to prepare a Hazard Mitigation Grant Proposal.</li>
</ol>
<h6>Phase: GIS Data</h6>
<ol>
<li>Find external sources that provide GIS data for each hazard mitigation strategy.</li>
<li>Customize Infrastructure Planner so that your community can gather the remaining GIS data.</li>
<li>Write tutorials to help your community install and use Infrastructure Planner and the Hazard Mitigation Grant Proposal Wizard.</li>
</ol>
<h6>Phase: Cost Data</h6>
<ol>
<li>Find external sources that provide cost data for each hazard mitigation strategy.</li>
<li>Customize Infrastructure Planner so that your community can gather the remaining cost data.</li>
<li>Write tutorials to help your community install and use Infrastructure Planner and the Hazard Mitigation Grant Proposal Wizard.</li>
</ol>

<h5>Cost</h5>
