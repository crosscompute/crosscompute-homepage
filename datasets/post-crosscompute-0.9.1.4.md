We are happy to announce the latest release of our open source analytics automation system. Analysts can use our framework to create lightweight automations that are easy to maintain. Domain experts can deploy changes to automated reports without having to wait for engineers, resulting in faster iterations.

- [crosscompute 0.9.1.4](https://pypi.org/project/crosscompute) is our development server that transforms notebooks and scripts into web-based automations such as tools and reports.
- [crosscompute-views-map 0.1.1.2](https://pypi.org/project/crosscompute-views-map) adds interactive maps to your reports.
- [crosscompute-printers-pdf 0.2.0](https://pypi.org/project/crosscompute-printers-pdf) adds batch PDF print functionality.
- [jupyterlab-crosscompute 0.2.1](https://pypi.org/project/jupyterlab-crosscompute) lets you prototype automated reports without leaving the [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org) environment.
- [Documentation](https://docs.crosscompute.com) is online. Please see [configuration.yml](https://github.com/crosscompute/crosscompute/blob/develop/crosscompute/templates/configuration.yml) for available configuration options.
