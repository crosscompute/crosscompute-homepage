Your star analyst or engineer quits and nobody can update her spreadsheets and scripts. Making the first version is the easy part -- the hard work is rewriting code as customers use the product. Furthermore, large apps rely on engineers that are in short supply and expensive.

A better approach is to start small. Analysts should create lightweight automations that are easy to maintain. Domain experts can then deploy changes to analytics content without having to wait for engineers, resulting in faster iterations.
