Would you like your work to be featured in our upcoming computational marketplace? We want to hear from you!

We are building a computational marketplace and want to know what you would like to see and do when customers interact with the tools and reports on your profile. Gather leads? Get referral traffic? Let customers experiment with a package, SDK or API? Earn subscription revenue? Earn ad revenue? Fund future open source projects?

If you have a computational model, scenario planning or decision support tool that you would like to list in our marketplace, please [submit a short application](https://crosscompute.net/a/gather-creators) and we will contact you.
